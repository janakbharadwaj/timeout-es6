    <h1>SetTimeout in ES6</h1>

        <p>
            Here a for loop is initiated with a snippet of code in it, it has print area and a timed function
            timed function enters API block prints the text after 1 second as specified in it, where as normal text 
            enters the console directly, at firt the outer for loop whichis declared with "var" is been executed which 
            prints value of i 20 times from 0 to 19, since the
            timed function is given a lag of 1 sec the outer loop finishes execution in mean time and once the
            timed function starts execution i value will be 20 so it prints the text as number is 20 for 20 times.
            Since the var can be reassigned the value will be overwritten to new value each time.
        </p>

    <div class="two">

        <p>
            Here we are using the "let" to declare variable in for loop, the normal print will enter console but the timed 
            function will enter API to get executed later it enters to queue and then console, by that time all the normal
            prints will get executed and after the stack is empty the code in queue will get printed as the let value cannot
            be reassigned it will print the new value every time. and the output will be like 0,1,2,3....19 and in next line
            the text will print as number is 0, number is 1 .... number is 19.
